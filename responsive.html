                <li><h3>Class</h3>These fish are a part of the shark class! Known as chondrithyes, and containing all sharks, rays, and skates, it's a pretty cool class to be a part of.</li>
                <li><h3>Size</h3>Females can get up to 4ft! While males only get up to 3.5ft, just like me fr (short kings)</li>
                <li><h3>Cute</h3>They are cutie patooties! With their large eyes and smallness, these little guys fit their name</li>
