                <li><h2>Class</h2>These fish are a part of the shark class! Known as chondrithyes, and containing all sharks, rays, and skates, it's a pretty cool class to be a part of.</li>
                <li><h2>Size</h2>Females can get up to 4ft! While males only get up to 3.5ft, just like me fr (short kings)</li>
                <li><h2>Cute</h2>They are cutie patooties! With their large eyes and smallness, these little guys fit their name</li>
                <li><h2>Muddy Fellas</h2>While they are called Dogfish, they are also referred to as Mud Sharks</li>
                <li><h2>Vulnerability?</h2>They are currently not endangered, which is great!</li>
                <li><h2>Species</h2>Their scientific name is <i>Squalus acanthias</i></li>
