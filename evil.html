        <p>I don't want a lot for Christmas
            <br>There is just one thing I need
            <br>I don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
            <br>I just want you for my own
            <br>More than you could ever know
            <br>Make my wish come true
            <br>All I want for Christmas is you
            <br>Yeah
            <br>I don't want a lot for Christmas
            <br>There is just one thing I need (and I)
            <br>Don't care about the presents underneath the Christmas tree
            <br>I don't need to hang my stocking there upon the fireplace
            <br>Santa Claus won't make me happy with a toy on Christmas Day
            <br>I just want you for my own
            <br>More than you could ever know
            <br>Make my wish come true
            <br>All I want for Christmas is you
            <br>You, baby
            <br>Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
            <br>I won't even wish for snow (and I)
            <br>I'm just gonna keep on waiting underneath the mistletoe
            <br>I won't make a list and send it to the North Pole for Saint Nick
            <br>I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click
            <br>'Cause I just want you here tonight
            <br>Holding on to me so tight
            <br>What more can I do?
            <br>Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
            <br>You, baby
            <br>Oh-oh, all the lights are shining so brightly everywhere (so brightly, baby)
            <br>And the sound of children's laughter fills the air (oh, oh, yeah)
            <br>And everyone is singing (oh, yeah)
            <br>I hear those sleigh bells ringing
            <br>Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? (Yeah, oh)
            <br>Won't you please bring my baby to me?
            <br>Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
            <br>This is all I'm asking for
            <br>I just wanna see my baby standing right outside my door
            <br>Oh, I just want you for my own
            <br>More than you could ever know
            <br>Make my wish come true
            <br>Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
            <br>You, baby
            <br>All I want for Christmas is you, baby
            <br>All I want for Christmas is you, baby
            <br>All I want for Christmas is you, baby
            <br>All I want for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby
            <br>All I want (I want) for Christmas (all I really want) is you, baby</p>
